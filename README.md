# External_Interrupts-ECE3731-
I aim to have an ongoing event that happens (flashing green) and then interrupt that event through external inputs. <br>
That is to be achieved through the use of assembly language and an interrupt-driven approach. <br>
This project was divided into two parts a pre lab and a post lab<br> <br>
Files included: <br>
1) The pdf with details requirements <br>
2) The detailed pdf report inlcuding procedure and details <br>
3) The main.asm files for both parts (This is the assembly code) [This will not assebmle without proper configurtion {check #4}]<br> 
4) Both parts as a zip file containing all configurations of board for proper assembling<br> <br>
**Note that the report contains both parts of the assembly code**<br>
**Also note that this is HCS12 assembly and needs the HCS12 board to be flashed on along with _CodeWarriors_ the assembler**
